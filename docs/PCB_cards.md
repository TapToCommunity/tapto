# PCB Cards
Want to have some cool little PCB cards for your favorite games?  All you need to fo is order some of these, print some labels and stick on an NFC sticker tag.

Please note that the small Switch cards will need to smaller rectangle type NFC tag but the medium and large sized cards can take either.

## Ordering PCBs

### Which PCB Type To Order?
These cards are currently done in either 2-layer PCBs or 6-layer PCBs.  This is because JLC PCB has great offers for doing small batch runs of green 6-layer PCBs with ENIG (gold) finish.  Due to size limitations on this deal (max 50mm x 50mm) it will only work for the switch and medium sized cards and you are limited to green PCBs.  If you want to get another color, or do normal sized cards you will need to get some of the 2-layer PCB files.  JLC PCB has the same great offers on 2-layer PCBs without ENIG finish (boards will be silver) at a size up to 100mm x 100mm.

4 - Choose the following options for the board:<br/>
- Base Material = FR-4<br/>
- Layers = 2 (should auto-populate)<br/>
- Dimensions = (should auto-populate) to 21.5mm * 31.1mm for the Switch cards and 30.25mm x 50.25mm for the medium sized cards <br/>
- PCB Qty = 5<br/>
- Product Type = Industrial/Consumer electronics<br/>
- Different Design = 1<br/>
- Delivery Format = Single PCB<br/>
- PCB Thickness = 1.6<br/> (NOTE 1)
- PCB Color = Any color you like<br/>
- Silkscreen = (defaults to white for all except white boards which is black)<br/>
- Surface Finish = HASL(with lead)<br/>
- Outer Copper Weight = 1oz<br/>
- Via Covering = Tented<br/>
- Board Outline Tolerance = +0.2mm(regular)<br/>
- Confirm Production file = No<br/>
- Remove Order Number = Yes<br/>
- Flying Probe Test = Fully Test<br/>
- Gold Fingers = No<br/>
- Castellated Holes = No<br/>
- Edge Plating = No<br/>
- No advanced options<br/>

* NOTE 1 - If you are making the Switch cards then 1.6mm should be fine.  If you are doing the medium cards then you can go as thin as 0.8mm for the same price but  you may not be able to do it in all colors for the same price.

5 - Click on `SAVE TO CART`<br/>
6 - Go through checkout process, ensure to select Global Standard Direct Line shipping to keep costs low (NOTE 1)
