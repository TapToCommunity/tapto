TapTo is an open source system for launching games and scripted actions using physical objects like NFC cards. It's a great way to make playing games more accessible and add some fun to your gaming setup!

See the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below for everything you need to get up and running. Additional hardware is required but is aimed to be cheap and easily available. Please [join the Discord](https://wizzo.dev/discord) if you need any help or want to show off your work!

TapTo is currently supported on these platforms:
- [MiSTer FPGA](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/)
- [Commodore 64 (via TeensyROM)](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/blob/main/docs/NFC_Loader.md)
